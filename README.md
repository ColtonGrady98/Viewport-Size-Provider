# viewport_size_provider

These files are meant to provide a way to add a useful viewport size provider to your React Typescript project in as modular a fashion as possible.

There are two complete packages here: 

- redux_approach is for integration into a React-Redux project.

- context_approach is for use in any React Typescript project that you don't want to use Redux in (or at least not use Redux for this particular purpose).

Note: the ViewportConsumer component is not necessary to provide viewport size values to your project, it is only a demonstration of how to access these values, for those unfamiliar.

## Enjoy.
